
## Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is another dependency management tool written in Swift.

Add the following line to your Cartfile:

```
github "imaginary-cloud/CameraManager" >= 4.3
```

And run `carthage update` to build the dynamic framework.
